Code for my implementation on menace by [Donald Michie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine)

TODO illustration

Menace is a tic-tac-toe mechanical artificial intelligence that use reinforcement learning in the form of beads of colors and matchboxes.
Here you will find the code to obtain the 304 states for every matchbox and all the files you will need to recreate my implementation.

I've also created a web interface to track statistics of training and simplying the search for the correct box.
